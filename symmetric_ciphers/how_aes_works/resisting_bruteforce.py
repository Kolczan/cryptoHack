# It turns out that there is an attack on AES that's better than bruteforce,
# but only slightly â€“ it lowers the security level of AES-128 down to 126.1 bits, and hasn't been improved on for over 8 years.
# Given the large "security margin" provided by 128 bits, and the lack of improvements despite extensive study, it's not considered a credible risk to the security of AES.
# But yes, in a very narrow sense, it "breaks" AES.
